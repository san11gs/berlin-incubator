Dear Sir or Madam,

New Horizons - Spring 3 with Flex/Air on GAE Cloud

Doesnt' sound new to you? The new thing is to provide an all-in-one overview with following targets:
* very practical and straight forward 
* Covers Maven, BlazeDS, Flex, Air, Google App Engine, JPA on GAE, PermissionHandling.
* Tunraround of the hole eco-system

What we want to do is to provide a ready-to-go solution for interested developers. A result of the refcard might be a Spring-maven-archetype.
